<h1>Income level vs Health Status</h1>

The Impact of Individual Income on Health Behavior A Case Analysis By Narendra Kharel, Nashville Software School, DA13, March 06, 2025


# Motivation 

I am curious to explore the intersection of socioeconomic factors and public health. How the incom level affect the health outcomes of an individual, which is a critical area of study with real-world implications. 
Understanding how median income and unemployment rates impact health outcomes can provide valuable insights into the root causes of health disparities. By addressing these factors, policymakers, 
organizations, and communities can develop targeted interventions to improve public health and promote equity.


# Data questions

•	Are there significant regional variations in the impact of median income and unemployment rates on health outcomes?
•	Is there a specific income threshold beyond which improvements in health outcomes?
•	How does unemployment influence specific health outcomes?
•	How do public health policies or welfare programs mitigate the adverse effects of low income and high unemployment on health outcomes?

## Data

To answer these questions, I used US census data for median income by state from year 2000 to year 2022. I also used unemployment rate data fro the same period. To get the health assesment data I used health 
survey data for the year 2021 and 2022.



# Technologies Used

-Excel, Python/Pandas, PowerBI, Git etc.
To this case study, I utilized a combination of powerful technologies and tools.  I began with Analytical Approach includes  Data cleaning and preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify initial trends and outliers, Statistical modeling to quantify relationships and Visualization 
of key insights to make findings easily interpretable.I used Jupyter Notebook 7.2, where I utilized Python for extensive data exploration and analysis through its powerful libraries to clean, transform, and 
analyze the dataset effectively. In order to gain a better understanding of the data, I used Microsoft Excel for initial data visualization and further analysis, creating charts and tables that highlighted significant trends and patterns. Finally, I used Power BI to create an 
interactive presentation that provided more meaningful explanations of the data. This dynamic dashboard not only showed the findings in graphical terms but also supported dynamic interaction with 
the data so that it is easier to deduce actionable insight and present the same in a compelling manner.

# The process 

- Getting required data 
- Cleaning and organizing data using Python
- Moving data to Power BI and create visualization
- Push to the git hub version control 


# Challenges

During the work on this project, I encountered difficulties in data preprocessing and cleaning because of missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers. Comprehending intricate data relationships with limited 
experience in data analysis also meant learning sophisticated Python methods. Moreover, combining data from Jupyter Notebook, Excel, and Power BI required meticulous handling to ensure consistency. 
Interactive Power BI dashboard design was tricky from the standpoint of optimizing performance as well as determining appropriate visual objects for effective storytelling. Getting past 
these obstacles required intense research, experimentation, and continuous improvement.
